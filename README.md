Is a notation influenced partially by notations like json and toml,
but with some changes aimed to make it easier to write a parser for.  
This was originally designed as an exercise for myself to design a notation  
and to write a parser for it, but it should also be useable as a general purpose notation since, atleast the beef parser is quite optimized by now.

## Goals of the language
- Easy to write a parser for
- Able to express most simple objects that a programming language may create
- Human write- and readable

## Example
```
t name Player
o position
 - n x 17.5
 - n y 10
 - n z 90
```

 ## Contributing
 If you want to suggest features for future versions you can open a Issue and if you
 have written a parser, you may send a pull request for me to add it to the list
